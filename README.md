## About The Project

A simple midfield scouting/analysis app built using Streamlit. I decided to use Streamlit since there is low overhead to get it set up, it supports multiple modern plotting and analysis libraries, and it can deployed without any hassle and be made available for sharing instantly!

The set up is straightforward as well. Here are the commands you need to run the project locally, which would never be the case because the link is available for anyone to acceess :)

Assuming you have Python already on your machine:

pip3 install matplotlib==3.10.0
pip3 install mplsoccer==1.4.0
pip3 install pandas==2.2.3
pip3 install plotly==5.24.1
pip3 install streamlit==1.42.0
pip3 install streamlit-extras==0.5.0

streamlit run 1_1_-_Home.py

And voila! Enjoy :)
